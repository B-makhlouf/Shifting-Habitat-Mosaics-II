### This script will be used for three things 

# 1. Produce an overall map of variability in production across the landscape during the course of the dataset 
# 2. Produce a set of maps illustrating productivity and variability (bivariate chloropleth)
# 3. Relate Productivity and variability by *expanded* tributary, assess whether there is a linear or non linear trend 
# 4. Calculate cv of Canada vs Canadian components (Trib groups)
# 5. Calculate how Cv is expressed based on max trib group.
