# Shifting Habitat Mosaics II 

## Introduction

Pacific salmon in Western Alaska watersheds are comprised of multiple unique stocks, many of which display unique life history strategies such as run timing and location of natal origin. Management of the fishery is predicated on adjustments to harvest at the mouth of major tributaries, which aims to maintain genetic and life history diversity while managing allocation between multiple stakeholders and across international boundaries. To do so requires an understanding of how salmon subpopulations are distributed across the landscape, and how these patterns change in space and time. To date, however, our understanding of these patterns are limited by the spatial resolutin of current methods; namely Genetic Stock identification. However, variation within current management units may be substantial, and management for this diverity requires a more detailed understanding of the spatial distribution of salmon subpopulations. Sr8786 in salmon otolith has been illustrated to be useful to this point, as the relative ratio Sr87/Sr86 varies across the landscape and is faithfully recorded into the structure of the otolith ( Kennedy et al., 1997, Brennan et al., 2019). In the Nushagak River Basin, these methods have been used to reveal substantial variation in the distribution of salmon subpopulations across the landscape, and how these patterns change in space and time. To date, this has not been done in Alaska's largest watersheds; the Yukon and Kuskokwim River Basins. This project aims to explore how patterns of production change at multiple spatial scales in these river basins using Otolith Sr8786. 


## Objectives and Approach

1. Produce estimates of the spatial distribution of salmon in the Yukon and Kuskokwim for full dataset 

        Approach: Produce natal origin maps for each year available in both the Yukon and Kuskokwim 

2. Produce estimates of the spatial distribution of salmon in the Yukon and Kuskokwim within each year 
    
        Approach: Produce natal origin maps for ech quantile within each year. I.e. 2015 Q1 

3. Assess the distribution of variability across the basin 
    
            Approach: Produce a map illustrating the spatial distribution of CV for all years available in both the Yukon and Kuskokwim 

4. Assess the productivity/variability tradeoff/ interplay 

            Approach: Produce a map illustrating the spatial distribution of CV for all years available in both the Yukon and Kuskokwim

            Determine if there is a relationship between productivity and variability by *Expanded* tributary. 

5. Assess how aggregation decreases the potential to express variability 
    
                Approach: Calculate the CV of Canada assignment across the timeseries of the data 

                Assess the tributary groupings CV within canada in the same time
    
                Select tributary groupings which have a high level of heterogeneity. Grab all Xth level tributaries and lower, calculate cv over the dataset, and compare to other highest tributary groupings. 

6. Assess how selection of maximum posterior impacts the results 

                Approach: Produce all of the above using different thresholds from .7- .9 

7. Assess how things would look different without the distribution of error in Sr87/86 
    
                    Approach: Produce all of the above but with setting a constant error value across the dataset which is the lowest currently available.
